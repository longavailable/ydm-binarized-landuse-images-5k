Data repository to store the binarized landuse images in YDM for the article of 'Precipitation Trends using Gridded Dynamic Sampling Zones: Case Study Yangtze Delta Megalopolis'.

- The dimension is 144*162, and resolution is 5000m.
- 0, 1, and 2 indicate NoDataValue, non-urban, and urban respectively.
- Generated by scripts [ydm-landuse/002-binarize-ydm-landuse.py](https://github.com/longavailable/ydm-landuse/blob/main/002-binarize-ydm-landuse.py).

- Images used for 1992 - 2020 were extracted from ESA-CCI-LC.

- Images used for 2021 - 2050 were simulated by YDM-LCCM.
